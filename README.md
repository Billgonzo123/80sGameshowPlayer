CRT Flash Back Machine is designed to fill this empty void, and hit you with a healthy dose of nostalgia! View hundreds of vintage programming from the past century on your favorite old CRT television! Sit back and let the good times roll!

## Instructions

This program is specifically designed for the use of a standard definition tube TV set.  It is recommened to run this program on a device such as the Raspberry Pi, but the minimum requirements are:

- Device capable of playing videos in a web browser.
- ~~device capable of 480i/p video-out and a compatible screen~~
- New vertical, horizontal shift and overscan allow for adjustments for larger resolutions

Furthermore, and most importantly, you MUST configure your browser to allow autoPlay. Due to the nature of this program, there is no user input to initiate the video player. The ultimate expiriance is had with a dedicated device that automattically boots into a web borwser with this program as its home page,which is why a linux based hobby computer is the best choice.
